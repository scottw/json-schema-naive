A simplistic implementation of the JSON schema v4 spec.

    use JSON::Schema::Naive;

    my $s = JSON::Schema::Naive->new($schema);

    $s->validate($object)
      or die join("\n\t", "The following errors occurred:", $s->errors);

This software is proof-of-concept and alpha quality. Its interface may
change at any time. Use at your own risk.
